# Home Paint Manager

Home Paint Manager is a simple Sinatra app that will let you create an account to store and edit wall color information about each room of your home.

## Installation

To run this app, open your terminal and run

```ruby
git clone git@github.com:MRod21/home_paint_manager.git
```

Then change into the directory "home_paint_manager" and run "bundle install".

## Usage

Once the gem installation is complete, enter "shotgun" in your terminal and copy/paste the IP address that appears into your browser. This should take you to the welcome page. From there, it can be operated as a functioning website.

## Development

The rake task "rake console" is available for you to drop into pry at any time, without having to have put a binding.pry in place previously.
